# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project built using React, SCSS, Framer Motion, Slider JS, and more. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

## Technologies Used

- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that allows you to use variables, nested rules, and more.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations and gestures for React.
- **Slider JS**: A JavaScript library for creating sliders and carousels.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive and works on all devices.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion.
- **Interactive Elements**: Interactive sliders and carousels using Slider JS.
- **Modular Code**: The project is built with reusable components for easy maintenance and scalability.
